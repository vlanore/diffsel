/**
 * A model is defined as a Graphical Model:
 * - a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with N nodes
 * - the nodes of the DAG are random variables (X_n)
 * - the joint probability law is given by
 *   \prod_n P(X_n | Pa(X_n))
 *   where  Pa(X_n) represents the set of all parents of node X_n
 *
 * A model implements MCMC:
 * - GetLogProb returns the log of the probability (or probability density)
 * mentioned above
 * - Sample draws a model configuration from this joint probability
 * - Move resample the model's current configuration conditional on the data */
